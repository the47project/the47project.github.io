# What is the 47 project?

We are a group of like-minded individuals and concerned citizens of
India. We believe that the political and social situation in India is
untenable and in the near future the whole region of South Asia
will face a humanitarian crisis engendered by the policies of the
Narendra Modi led BJP government.

## Our Goals

We have three primary goals:

- We want the world to have accurate and current information about the
situation in India.
- We want to provide historical and political analysis based on data,
statistics and evidence related to the situation in India.
- In the long term, we want to create a network of activists,
scholars, politicians, and any concerned human being who are
interested in changing the situation in India. We want to do this by
creating grassroots organisations inside and outside the country.

We seek to build a transnational, internationalist and
leftist space of solidarity with Indian people focused on the working class,
minorities, and all those who suffer at the hands of the
undemocratic government of India.  ​​​​​​​

## Background and Motivation

India is at the risk of facing a serious political and social
destabilization in the near future.

The Narendra Modi led BJP government, which has been in power in India
for the last ten years has transformed the largest democracy of the
world into an electoral tyranny.

The political landscape of India has changed drastically in the last
year - where the federal structure of the union is on the verge of
collapse. This paves the way to a centralized unitary governmental system.

The electoral politics of India have also changed in substance and
form by giving rise to the ultra-right wing, Hindu majoritarian
rhetoric that is also becoming fundamental in changing the social
fabric of the country.

Over the last ten years, India, which is home to 1.5 billion people,
and contains multitudes of identities with a diversity of languages,
religious practices, and ways of life has witnessed a fast erosion of tolerance,
communal harmony, and other social and cultural ethos, and is heading towards
becoming a Hindu-Hindi majoritarian monolith.

### What are the objectives of the BJP and why should we resist?

BJP has a twofold objective in the region - first to convert India to
a Hindu nation-state and then to create a greater India.

Unless, we act now to resist against the BJP both inside and outside
the country, eventually a political and social catastrophe will
prevail over one-fifth of the total human population.

The Western countries: US, UK, France, Germany, and others are well
aware of the situation but are maintaining tactical silence because
India could be a useful geo-strategic partner in a future military
clash with China.

### What has changed politically?

India has witnessed curbing of power of the individual provincial
government - the extreme example of which is the dismissal of the
statehood of Jammu and Kashmir and dissolving its residual autonomy
that it enjoyed within the Indian Union.

There is also an unprecedented threat to Indian democracy as the
independence of the judiciary is now under question.

During the past few years, the judiciary has cleared all the obstacles
for the government to implement its draconian policies and clandestine
political objectives.

Feedom of press is a myth in India- as most of the mainstream media
are owned by the crony-capitalist friends of the BJP. The media shows
zero interest in asking accountability from the government.

On the contrary, they work as the propaganda machinery of the BJP and
spread communal tension, jingoism, hatred towards minorities through
different tactics, including serving of fake news.

Any independent media, critical of the government faces the wrath of
the  government as the individual journalists suffer from criminal
charges against them, including draconian oppressive laws (UAPA,
NSA). Media houses get raided regularly by the different government
agencies.

Activists - whether political or social, organized or unorganized -
critical of the government receive the same treatment as journalists
or even worse as many of them have been in prison for years without trial.

### What has changed socially?

India is moving to point of no return, where the social
fabric has been ripped to shreds. A country where diverse people from
different ethnicities and religions lived together harmoniously will vanish.
The prospect of large-scale violence against Muslims looms large.

The BJP, its parental organization RSS, and its
militant wing Bajarang Dal, and other hundreds of local Hindu
nationalist organization are working tirelessly toward their goal of a
Hindu-Hindi nation-state and changing the diverse nature of Indian society.

Muslims, especially in the Northern part of the country live under
perpetual threat of violence. There are several laws,
which discriminate against Muslims,
including acts that criminalize inter-faith marriages.

This raises the spectre of the Nazi preparation for persecution of
minorities in Germany.
